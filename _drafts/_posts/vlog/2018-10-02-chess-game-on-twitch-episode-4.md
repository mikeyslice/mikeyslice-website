Chess games are fun. Especially when played on Twitch. Check out this gameplay from when I streamed live on [Twitch.tv/mikeyslice
](http:/www.twitch.tv/mikeyslice)

I started this channel because I love to help others. My first video was shot from my bedroom in Detroit, Michigan. I'm here to educate, entertain, and inspire others to enhance their skills, and boost their income.

You'll know when you stumble upon my content as soon as you see the iconic Mikey Slice logo, or my big outlined face on a thumbnail. When you login to YouTube my channel is the first one, without a doubt, you will click on. I don't believe in getting paid by the hour. I believe that the better you get at what you do, the more you should get paid. Sounds reasonable, right?

I am, and always will be, the face of this channel. Are you ready to enhance your skills, and boost your income? If so, then click the subscribe button, and SMASH the bell so you don't miss ANYTHING!
