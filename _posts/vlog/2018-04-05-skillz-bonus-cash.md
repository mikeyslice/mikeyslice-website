excerpt: So you’ve made your first deposit, received some Skillz bonus cash, and played a few games, but when you go to withdraw it says you only have $50 available for withdraw. You have a $75 balance yet you can only withdraw $50 of it. The reason is because you have $25 in bonus cash.

## How Skillz Bonus Cash Works | How to Earn Bonus Cash | How it Affects Your Account | Mobile App

Use my Skillz Promo Code 2F05J on your first deposit for up to $40 bonus cash by visiting https://skillz.com/p/2f05J and start your journey to make money playing mobile games, just like me

So you’ve made your first deposit, received some Skillz bonus cash, and played a few games, but when you go to withdraw it says you only have $50 available for withdraw. You have a $75 balance yet you can only withdraw $50 of it. The reason is because you have $25 in bonus cash.

## Skillz Bonus Cash

When you make a deposit, they give you Skillz bonus cash on top of your deposit. If you used my PROMO CODE 2F05J you got an additional $15 on top of the Skillz bonus cash they give you. This promo code is only good for one use.

Each game you play you will use a portion of both real, and Skillz bonus cash. 90% real cash and 10% bonus. If you don’t have any real cash then you will use 100% of your Skillz bonus cash obviously.

Let’s say you have $75 and enter into a $10 game for the entry fee of $6. You’re going to put in $5.40 real cash and $.60 Skillz bonus cash towards the match. If you win that game you will receive your $.60 Skillz bonus cash back along with $9.40 real cash which you can use later on to withdrawal.

## Cash Matches

Withdrawing With Bonus Cash Remaining

If you choose to withdraw your $50 with $25 Skillz bonus cash still in your account you will have to forfeit your $25 Skillz bonus cash. So keep playing and turn that $25 into some real cash as well as earn Ticketz towards that Porsche Boxster that everyone dreams of owning!

It is also worth noting that any withdraw below $10 will be charged a $1.50 processing fee. I’ve withdrawn many times and it does take about 4-6 weeks to receive it as they have to monitor all games played to ensure that there is no cheating before issuing a check.
