Inspired by Kingscrusher, I play many chess games in front of my viewers. Join me as I learn chess. From [chess openings,](https://chessopeningsexplained.com/membership-account/membership-levels/?pa=0D60A35DDB) to chess endgames. It's all here! I'm getting better too since I like to do chess tactics in my free time thanks to my unlimited tactics trainer on Chess.com. This is Episode 7 of the [official YouTube Series "Playing Chess on Twitch."

The Sicilian Defense was not a choice, but rather one of my own "Chess ideas" Chess just comes to me. I make moves I think are good and they turn out being actual opening theory! [Join my Chess Club on Chess.com and grow with me.](https://www.chess.com/membership?ref_id=33583865)
