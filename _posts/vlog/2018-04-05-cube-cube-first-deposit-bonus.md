#### Key features:
• Drag blocks to the board.

### Cube Cube Promo Code

Make sure BEFORE you select your deposit amount to click on the “Enter Promo Code” button. Then enter the Cube Cube promo code: 2F05J. This will get you up to $40 bonus cash on your first deposit.

How to Use Bonus Cash

Each game you play you will use a portion of both real, and Skillz bonus cash. 90% real cash and 10% bonus. If you don’t have any real cash then you will use 100% of your Skillz bonus cash obviously.

Let’s say you have $75 and enter into a $10 game for the entry fee of $6. You’re going to put in $5.40 real cash and $.60 Skillz bonus cash towards the match. If you win that game you will receive your $.60 Skillz bonus cash back along with $9.40 real cash which you can use later on to withdraw.

If you choose to withdraw your $50 with $25 Skillz bonus cash still in your account you will have to forfeit your $25 Skillz bonus cash. So keep playing and turn that $25 into more real cash. You will also earn Ticketz (Skillz loyalty program) to use towards accessories and gift cards.

### Withdraw Your Cash

I’ve withdrawn many times and it does take about 4-6 weeks to receive it since they have to monitor all games played, to ensure that there is no cheating before issuing a check. All withdraws below $10 will be charged a $1.50 processing fee. Then you can brag to your friends about how you make money playing mobile games while they’re still trying to go pro at COD or Halo.
