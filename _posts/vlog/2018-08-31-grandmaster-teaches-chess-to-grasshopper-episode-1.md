Grandmaster Eugene Perelshteyn teaches grasshopper, MikeySlice. This was recorded live on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv), but after the session I cut out the silent parts to give [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) an action packed video that my viewers can learn from. Eugene shares his grandmaster Chess ideas during my gameplay while I'm trying to check mate my opponent. 



Chess game play from [Twitch streamer, MikeySlice](http://www.twitch.tv/mikeyslice), played on Chess.com while streaming live on Twitch. Inspired by Kingscrusher, I play many chess games in front of my viewers. Join me as I learn chess. From chess openings, to chess endgames. It's all here! I'm getting better too since I like to do chess tactics in my free time thanks to my unlimited tactics trainer on Chess.com. This is Episode 1 of the official [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/mikeyslice?sub_confirmation=1) Series "[\#Grandmaster Teaches #Chess to Grasshopper](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7lVTzYgfl7Hibd8rZ-jER9K70wmZzr_Z)"



The Sicilian Defense was not a choice, but rather one of my own "Chess ideas" Chess just comes to me. I make moves I think are good and they turn out being actual opening theory!

I started this [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/mikeyslice?sub_confirmation=1) because I love to help others.
