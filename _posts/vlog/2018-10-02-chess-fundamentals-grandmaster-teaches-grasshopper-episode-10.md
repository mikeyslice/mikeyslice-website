I started this channel because I love to help others. My first video was shot from my bedroom in Detroit, Michigan. I'm here to educate, entertain, and inspire others to enhance their skills, and boost their income.

You'll know when you stumble upon my content as soon as you see the iconic Mikey Slice logo, or my big outlined face on a thumbnail.

I believe that the better you get at what you do, the more you should get paid. Sounds reasonable, right?
