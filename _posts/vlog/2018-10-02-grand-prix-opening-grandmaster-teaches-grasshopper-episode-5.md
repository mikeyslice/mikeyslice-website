"Play Bishop g5 because you want to hit the queen with the bishop" - GM Eugene Perelshteyn. That's a direct quote from the video.



GM, Grandmaster, Eugene Perelshteyn teaches grasshopper, MikeySlice. This was recorded live on Twitch, but after the session I cut out the silent parts to give YouTube an action packed video that my viewers can learn from. Eugene shares his grandmaster Chess ideas during my gameplay while I'm trying to check mate my opponent.

Chess game play from Twitch streamer, MikeySlice, played on Chess.com while streaming live on Twitch. Inspired by Kingscrusher, I play many chess games in front of my viewers.

This is Episode 5 of the official YouTube Series "#Grandmaster Teaches #Chess to Grasshopper"



I started this channel because I love to help others. My first video was shot from my bedroom in Detroit, Michigan. I'm here to educate, entertain, and inspire others to enhance their skills, and boost their income.



You'll know when you stumble upon my content as soon as you see the iconic Mikey Slice logo, or my big outlined face on a thumbnail. When you login to YouTube my channel is the first one, without a doubt, you will click on. I don't believe in getting paid by the hour. I believe that the better you get at what you do, the more you should get paid. Sounds reasonable, right?
