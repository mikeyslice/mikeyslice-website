## Daniel Rensch Of Chess.com Talks About His “Dad Sauce” During A Live Stream on Twitch 👅

Danny claims his 2 year old loves Dad sauce. Find out exactly what he’s talking about in this short video!

I started this channel by sharing my Skillz, refer-a-friend code, in a video. Whenever someone used my code, on their first deposit, I got $50 bonus cash in the game. That video was shot in my bedroom at my parents’ house in Detroit, Michigan. I’m here to educate, entertain, and inspire others to enhance their skills, and boost their income through my videos.

You’ll know when you stumble upon my content as soon as you see the iconic Mikey Slice logo, or my big outlined face on a thumbnail. When you login to YouTube my channel is the first one, without a doubt, you will click on. I don’t believe in being a slave to time by working hourly. I believe that the better you get at what you do, the more you should get paid.

I am, and always will be, the face of this channel. Are you ready to enhance your skills, and boost your income? If so, then SMASH the subscribe button, and hit the bell, to get notified when I have new content coming out.
